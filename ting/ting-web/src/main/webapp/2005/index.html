<p style="font-weight: bold;">
Topic: Spring Unleashed<br/>
Speaker: Keith Donald
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p> Bio: Keith has been involved with the Spring Framework as a user and core
contributor since July 2003. He is the founder of the Spring Rich Client
Project (spring-rich), an emerging module built on core Spring that
substantially reduces the time and effort required to build a well-architected,
enterprise-ready java desktop applications. He is also the co-lead of the
Spring Web Flow module, a core Spring web offering that lets developers model
business processes that span many screens in a logical manner.  </p>

<p> Abstract: The past two years have seen a growing trend towards
lightweight architectures as alternatives to traditional EJB-centric
architectures.  In this approach, application services and domain objects are
designed as POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), resulting in fine-grained
application components that are reusable and testable outside a container. This
can significantly increase productivity and allows easier use of agile
processes in J2EE development. Key enabling technologies include lightweight
containers such as Spring and HiveMind, and O/R mapping frameworks such as
Hibernate, JDO and TopLink.  </p>

<p> This session introduces the Spring Framework and its lightweight container
architecture, focusing on its powerful Dependency Injection capabilities, the
Spring AOP framework and the popular Spring JDBC framework. It will highlight
Spring's transaction management capabilities--in particular, declarative
transactions for POJOs--and illustrate data access object design for strategies
such as JDBC and Hibernate, which are supported out-of-the-box and integrated
in a consistent architectural style.  </p>

<p> The session will discuss the value-add of using a lightweight container
within a J2EE application, contrasting it with traditional programming models.
It will show that Spring does not compete with J2EE servers and the core system
services provided by them; instead, Spring adds architectural value within J2EE
applications, leveraging J2EE services without coupling application components
to a concrete J2EE environment.  </p>

<p> Attendees will learn about the motivation for the lightweight container
movement and the benefits of a lightweight, test-driven, development approach
from two pioneers in the area who are also best-selling authors on the topic.
They will learn about the valuable services that the Spring Framework provides
for a wide variety of architectural scenarios.  </p>

Topic: Insider's View of Hibernate 3.0<br/>
Speaker: Gavin King
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p> Bio: Gavin is the founder of the Hibernate project, the leading
persistence solution for Java. He is an active member of the JSR-220 expert
group, and contributed heavily to the design of EJB 3.0. With Christian Bauer,
he was author of /Hibernate in Action/. Gavin works for JBoss, Inc, leading the
development of Hibernate, implementing EJB 3.0, and providing services to JBoss
customers. He lives in Melbourne, Australia, and Atlanta, Georgia </p>

<p> Abstract: This presentation will focus on Hibernate and the relationship
between Hibernate and the upcoming EJB 3 feature set. Highlighted will be new
features in Hibernate 3.0 including inheritance mapping, temporal and regional
data, and the ability to use Hibernate along with hand-written SQL as a JDBC
framework.  </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
Topic: Workflow Made Easy with JBoss jBPM<br/>
Speaker: Kevin Barfield
</p>

<div class="indent">

Kevin worked in the middleware application market for 10 years as an architect
and developer. Kevin has a Masters of Science and Bachelor of Science in
Electrical Engineering from the University of Tennessee.  </p>

<p> Abstract: This presentation will cover the workflow foundation called
graph oriented programming. Gain insight in how graph oriented programming
integrates with the java platform and how it allows the usage of the JVM as the
runtime environment for business processes. Server side developers will learn
what to expect from a workflow management system.  </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
Topic: java.net: Turning "community" into the killer app for Java
Developers<br/>
Speaker: John Bobowicz
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p> Bio: John is the CTO of www.java.net, founder and original community
manager.  As java.net CTO, He is getting more involved within the community and
focusing on the technologies of java.net. This includes letting the world know
about cool technologies and projects on java.net as well as looking for cool
and new technologies to join java.net. He gets to write more code in this role
and tinker with new technologies and that should be fun! John will also be
working to get more involvement out of the "Java Industry" and hopefully
recruit more companies and industry groups to join and contribute.  </p>

<p> Abstract: The killer app for Java Developers is collaboration and java.net
provides the ultimate online community for collaborative development.  Feature
rich with collaboration tools like Wikis, Blogs, CVS, Issue Tracking, Instant
Messaging, and more, java.net is a virtual playground for Java developers.
With over 130,000 members and 1,800+ projects, if there's something new or cool
going on in Java, it's happening on java.net.  Whether it's Java3D, Project
Looking Glass, Real Time Java, or Mustang, you will find it here.  Learn how
you can be part of these exciting innovations as they happen instead of just
reading about them elsewhere.  </p>
