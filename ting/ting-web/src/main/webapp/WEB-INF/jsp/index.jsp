            <h2 style="">What?</h2>

            <p>Atlanta&#8217;s most exciting conference for professional
            software developers is back in 2011! Come discover how the
            industry&#8217;s best minds use the latest technologies to build
            solutions to business problems. Network with other Atlanta software
            developers, and study real life case studies in application design and
            development.</p>

            <p>Our first four conference events were tremendous successes. Skip
            the travel headaches, expense, and mobs of people at other conferences
            and join us this March to experience one of the best developer
            conferences, presented by your fellow developers, right in the heart of
            the Southeast (and in your own backyard).</p>

            <p>This conference is an incredible value. Not only do we provide
               exceptional speakers and presentations but we also provide book
               raffles, food, a cocktail hour for networking and mingling with the
               speakers and much more.</p>

            <p><strong>Make sure to sign up early to ensure you get a seat this year!</strong></p>
