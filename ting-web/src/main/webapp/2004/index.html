<div class="header">Presentation topics</div>

<p><strong>MVC Web Framework Shootout - Neal Ford</strong></p>

<div class="indent"><p> Choosing the proper web framework for your next
  development project can be very mind-numbing and time-consuming.  The default
  answer is often go with Struts or simply roll-your-own.  This session will
  describe the best practices and design patterns associated with web
  application architecture and demonstrate the creation of the same application
  in several of the most popular frameworks, such as Struts, WebWork, Tapestry,
  and Cocoon.  </p></div>


<p><strong>Exploring Good Swing Design with JGoodies' Form Layout - Charlie Hubbard</strong></p>

<div class="indent"><p> In user interfaces good design means good layout.  One
  of the trickiest things to master in Swing is effective use of the
  LayoutManagers.  Sometimes even the simplest of designs are hard to
  accomplish with Swing's default LayoutManagers.  This presentation will
  explore what constitutes good layout, and demonstrates the features of
  JGoodies' free Form library that make good designs effortless.  This
  presentation will arm beginners and advanced developers with the information
  needed to build first class Java GUI s.  </p></div>

<p><strong>"Leveraging J2EE Security" - Rob Kischuk</strong></p>

<div class="indent"> <p> The robust security model of J2EE, is one of the
  industry's best-kept secrets.  It allows developers to quickly and easily
  manage user authentication and authorization through flexible, comprehesive
  APIs.  Learn how JSP, servlets, EJBs, and popular frameworks such as Struts
  are designed to take advantage of this security model, and how you can
  further customize the security to meet the needs of your applications.  Leave
  your custom authentication modules and servlet filters at the door, and find
  out just how easy it can be.  </p></div>
