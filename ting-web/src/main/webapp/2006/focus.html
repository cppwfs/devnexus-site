  <h1>Focus Sessions</h1>

  <h2>AJAX State of the Union (Ben Galbraith)</h2>

<p>Ben is a co-founder of Ajaxian.com and the co-host for the
Audible Ajax podcast.  His presentation will focus on the various
trends, toolkits, techniques, best practices and current state of the
art as it relates to web application development using AJAX -
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  Ben is currently on a world tour of
NoFluffJustStuff conferences, JavaOne and the Ajax Experience.</p>

  <h2>Dunamic User Interfaces w/ JSF and AJAX (Roger Kitain)</h2>

<p>
Dynamic User Interfaces With JavaServer. Faces and AJAX
JavaServer. Faces can be used to create highly dynamic Asynchronous
JavaScript. technology and XML (AJAX) sites. In this session we'll take
a look at how AJAX and JavaServer Faces can be used together to create
dynamic components. We will examine some of the features in the
JavaServer Faces 1.2 specification (as well as JavaServer Faces 2.0
specification proposals) that facilitate the use of AJAX. We'll also
take a look at some of the dynamic components available, as well as a
complete application, and we'll see how JavaScript. libraries such as
Dojo can be used.</p>

  <h2>Notes from the Java Frontier (Jim Waldo)</h2>

<p>
Even after ten years, the Java Programming Language and Environment
continue to stake out new territory. This talk will discuss some of the
directions that the language, and things being built using the language,
are going.
</p>

<p>
We will start by talking about some of the things that were presented at
JavaOne in San Francisco. Rather than discussing the big-bang
announcement items, we will try to concentrate on the small but
innovative uses in the Java ecosystem that may show where the mainstream
will be in the next five years.
</p>

<p>
We will then move on to talk about some of the work being done in Sun
Microsystems Laboratories. In particular, we will talk about attempts to
move the Java environment to the extremes. On one side, we will look at
moving Java to ever smaller devices (in this case, wireless sensors). At
the other, we will look at the work that is trying to build large-scale,
very long-lived systems exploiting Java.
</p>

<h2>Spring Framework 2.0: New and Noteworthy (Ben Hale)</h2>

<p>
In Spring Framework 2.0: New and Noteworthy, Ben Hale will outline the major
new features of Spring 2.0. Attendees will learn how to use Spring 2.0 to
greatly simplify the configuration of their applications across the entire
stack through use of domain-specific languages and smart defaults.  They
will see how to make their business services transactional in *one line* of
configuration code.  Other highlights include practical examples of creating
aspects using AspectJ's pointcut language, developing stateful business
components, implementing beans using dynamic languages such as Groovy and
Beanshell, receiving asynchronous messages with JMS, and leveraging Spring's
support for Java 5 language constructs.
</p>

  <h2>Introduction to XForms (Jason Chambers)</h2>

  <p>Consider document oriented applications. Examples may include
mortgage application processing, loan application processing, IRS tax
filings, Ordering systems, Invoicing systems. Examples of documents
that may flow through these applications include purchase orders,
invoices, shipping notices, mortgage applications, loan applications,
RFQs and so on.
</p>

<p>
Documents may enter your application in one of two ways. Maybe they
are transferred from another system e.g. an ERP system. Maybe
documents are created by human users filling out an on-line form.
</p>

<p>
Now consider how you would approach designing such a document-
oriented system. Of course, you could use good old HTML forms, a
sprinkling of Javascript and Struts/Validator on the server-side. As
AJAX is trendy right now, you may need to integrate your favorite
AJAX framework to provide a better user experience. Now you have to
consider how to handle the flat submitted form data and somehow
create an XML document from it so you can persist it or do whatever
you want with it.
</p>

<p>
Is it me or is this starting to look a little complex and a little
out of hand. Is there a better way of solving this problem?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps XForms - a W3C recommendation can help. Come get a high-level
overview of what XForms is and when it makes sense to use it. You
will learn about the state of browser support for XForms in addition
to Chiba, an open source XForms engine that resides on the server side.
</p>

<h2>Eclipse's Tips and Tricks (Ed Lance)</h2>

<p>This session has something for everyone. We'll start by
reviewing some Eclipse tips and tricks, then follow-up with a
discussion of some of the latest plug-ins available for Eclipse and
how to obtain them.  Finally, we'll demonstrate how to develop a
custom plug-in using the PDE (Plug-in Development Environment) and the
SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit).</p>
