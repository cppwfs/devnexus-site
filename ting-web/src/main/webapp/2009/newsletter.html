<p>Hello Java Users!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.DevNexus.com/"><b>DevNexus 2009</b></a> is the <a href="http://www.ajug.org/">Atlanta Java Users Group's</a> biggest and most economical educational event with world-class speakers on Java EE, open source technologies like Spring and Hibernate, and with deep dives in RIA (rich internent application) techniques and best practices on Flex, Dojo, and GWT.</p>

<p>There are <b>two full days</b> of back to back deep technical sessions where the goal is to immerse you in popular techniques &amp; technologies that will have a huge impact on the way you develop applications. Perhaps your organization is considering the move to "Web 2.0", AJAX and RIA? We've lined up a group of speakers who can bring you up to speed on the latest advancements in next generation user experience:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Peter Higgins, Dojo Project Lead - Dojo put the concept of AJAX and Web 2.0 on the proverbial map.  Peter will focus on how to design the slimmest, fastest and most responsive browser-based applications.</li>
    <li>Yakov Fain, Java Champion &amp; that dude on the Java Developer's Journal - Yakov has studied the world of RIA-focused frameworks and engines and will not only give us an overall view of the relative pros and cons, but will also deep dive into Adobe Flex.</li>
    <li>Bruce Johson, founder Google's GWT project - If you are not the JavaScript &amp; CSS guru type but you want RIAs, then GWT might be for you.  Bruce will be able to answer all of your questions related to GWT, and show you the ins and outs of this very interesting technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many Java EE shops are taking advantage of open source frameworks like Spring or Hibernate as the core of their application architecture:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Keith Donald, founding partner at SpringSource - Keith will give us an introduction to what's new in Spring 3.0 and deep dive into SpringMVC and WebFlow. Bring your toughest Spring-related questions.</li>
    <li>Emmanuel Bernard, core developer behind Hibernate - Emmanuel will focus on Hibernate scalability techniques, and, as the lead developer behind Hibernate Search, introduce you to some of the more advanced capabilities available to the Hibernate audience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps your interest is in the area of dynamic languages that run on the JVM:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Neal Ford, the world's most prolific developer conference speaker (Thoughtworks) - Neal will not only educate us on various dynamic programming language capabilities but will also give us some insights on what it means to be a professional software engineer in today's challenging market.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have speakers who will focus on application security, RESTful architecture, distributed cache &amp; scalability, content repositories and JPA (Java Persistence Architecture). </p>

<p>Our objective is to make sure that you not only walk away with practical knowledge that you can put to use immediately, but to also expand your horizons into new possibilities for your next software architecture. The average technical conference costs hundreds of dollars per day. Our goal as a non-profit Java-focused all-volunteer managed organization is to make sure that you have the least expensive, best learning and networking opportunities close to home. </p>

<p>Lunch and refreshments are included in the cost of the event ticket and those breaks provide excellent opportunities for you to meet with other Java developers. <a href="http://www.devnexus.com">Please register!</a></p>
